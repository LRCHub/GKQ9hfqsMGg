You hear another story everyday
Of some ill fated love that got away
And nearly every time it ends the same
When trust is gone, nobody wants the blame
You'll find
There's no one left to love you
In time
You learn to love yourself
Friends are here and friends will be away
New lovers kiss, and swear they'll never stray
But they stray
And every night that party ends the same
With too much wine they find that some thing's changed
And it's changed
You'll find
There's no one left to love you
In time
You learn to love yourself
You'll find
When no one's thinking of you
It's time
To care about yourself
You saw it on the news the other day
A movie star's romantic hideaway
And all the time you think they've got it made
A year and they're dividing the estate
Who gets the kids?
You'll find
There's no one left to love you
In time
You learn to love yourself
You'll find
When no one's thinking of you
It's time
To care about yourself
Feels alright when you start to laugh
Feels too good just to let is pass
Scared to say what you want to say
Tastes too sweet, just to end this way
Feels alright when you start to laugh
Feels too good just to let is pass
Scared to say what you want to say
Tastes too sweet, just to end this way
You'll find
It's time
