[00:00.49] For all the times that you rained on my parade
[00:05.41] And all the clubs you get in using my name
[00:09.92] You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
[00:14.80] You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't
[00:37.30] 
[00:19.73] And I didn't wanna write a song
[00:22.25] 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
[00:26.60] You still hit my phone up
[00:29.42] And baby, I'll be movin' on
[00:31.52] And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
[00:36.15] Maybe you should know that
[00:49.15] 
[00:38.93] My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
[00:43.26] And I never like to admit that I was wrong
[00:48.10] And I've been so caught up in my job
[00:51.29] Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
[00:55.65] I'm better sleeping on my own
[01:10.15] 
[00:58.28] 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
[01:02.99] Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
[01:07.65] And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
[01:13.44] You should go and love yourself
[01:28.94] 
[01:17.64] But when you told me that you hated my friends
[01:21.94] The only problem was with you and not them
[01:26.84] And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
[01:31.68] And tried to make me forget where I came from
[01:54.18] 
[01:36.54] And I didn't wanna write a song
[01:39.11] 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
[01:43.47] You still hit my phone up
[01:46.12] And baby, I'll be movin' on
[01:48.52] And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
[01:52.84] Maybe you should know that
[02:05.84] 
[01:55.86] My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
[02:00.47] And I never like to admit that I was wrong
[02:04.99] And I've been so caught up in my job
[02:07.98] Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
[02:12.42] I'm better sleeping on my own
[02:26.92] 
[02:14.92] 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
[02:19.68] Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
[02:24.49] And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
[02:30.10] You should go and love yourself
[02:45.60] 
[02:53.50] For all the times that you made me feel small
[02:58.26] I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
[03:03.13] I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
[03:07.76] Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
[03:29.76] 
[03:12.52] 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
[03:17.35] Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
[03:21.75] And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
[03:27.78] You should go and love yourself
[03:43.28] 
[03:31.77] 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
[03:36.46] Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
[03:41.17] And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
[03:44.86] Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
[03:47.22] You should go and love yourself
