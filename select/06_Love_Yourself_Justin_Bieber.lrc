[00:00.50] For all the times that you rained on my parade
[00:05.45] And all the clubs you get in using my name
[00:10.40] You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
[00:14.85] You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't
[00:19.77] And I didn't wanna write a song
[00:22.17] 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
[00:26.54] You still hit my phone up
[00:29.47] And baby, I'll be movin' on
[00:31.67] And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
[00:36.19] Maybe you should know that
[00:39.30] My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
[00:43.33] And I never like to admit that I was wrong
[00:48.28] And I've been so caught up in my job
[00:51.46] Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
[00:55.62] I'm better sleeping on my own
[00:58.37] 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
[01:03.20] Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
[01:07.86] And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
[01:13.41] You should go and love yourself
[01:17.77] But when you told me that you hated my friends
[01:22.30] The only problem was with you and not them
[01:26.96] And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
[01:31.76] And tried to make me forget where I came from
[01:36.51] And I didn't wanna write a song
[01:39.19] 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but

[02:53.54] For all the times that you made me feel small
[02:58.34] I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
