I never felt at ease in my own skin
From when I was a young boy
I didn't know myself then
And now I know that
Nothing's wrong with my heart
Nothing's wrong with my head
Nothing's wrong with the way I walk
I heard people talking
I am perfect naturally, and I'll bet all my money
No one else could love me quite like me, baby

Now I feel this way
I'm who I am, nobody else
I fill the world with love

Love yourself
Love, love yourself
That's all I wanna tell you
Love yourself
Love, love yourself
That's all I wanna tell you

Sleepless nights, remembering white lies
Can you see the truth?
Flowers staring at the mirror
Looking back at you, yeah
Nothing's wrong with your heart
Nothing's wrong with your head
Nothing's wrong with the way I laugh
Just heard people talking
You are perfect naturally, embrace your new reality
No one else could love you quite like you, baby

Now you feel this way
You who you are, nobody else
You fill the world with love-ooh, oh

Love yourself
Love, love yourself
That's all I wanna tell you
Love yourself
Love, love yourself
That's all I wanna tell you
Love yourself
Love, love yourself
That's all I wanna tell you
Love yourself (Love yourself, baby)
Love, love yourself
That's all I wanna tell you
